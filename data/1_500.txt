The measured position or the measured force is compared (408) with end effector constraints, where the end effector constraints include dead-bands in which the error measures associated with the robot are ignored. Impact of the error measures is reduced (412) on operation of the robot based on the comparison.    USE - Method for controlling a gripper-style end effector of a robot (claimed) to grasp and pull an object in an environment. Uses include but are not limited to telepresence robot, robot arm, humanoid, animal, insect, aquatic creature, wheeled device, submersible vehicle and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).    ADVANTAGE - The method enables allowing a grasp torque controller to remain stable for increased feedback gains and to recover performance that is degraded by increased friction as friction is increased. The method enables utilizing the end effector constraints of actuators and/or joints of the robot and an amount of impedance applied by the object being interacted with by the robot to cause the robot to be safely operated.    DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following:    (1) a robot    (2) a non-transitory computer-readable medium comprising a set of instructions for controlling a gripper-style end effector of a robot to grasp and pull an object in an environment.

The CSP linearly maps the noisy signal to reservoir states of a dynamical reservoir, and generates a high-dimensional state-space representation of the noisy signal by combining the noisy signal with the reservoir states. The CSP generates a delay-embedded state signal from the reservoir states, and denoises the reservoir states by removing noise from each reservoir state signal, resulting in a real-time denoised spectrogram of the noisy signal for further processing. The CSP generates a denoised waveform signal by combining the denoised reservoir states. The signal denoising process is implemented in software or digital hardware by converting the state-space representation of the dynamical reservoir to a system of delay difference equations and then applying a linear basis approximation.    USE - Cognitive signal processor for parallelized cognitive signal denoising in various applications. Uses include but are not limited to vehicle (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicle, plane, car, boat, robot) or man-portable applications, such as rapid detection and separation of significant objects (e.g., obstacles, terrain, other vehicles, persons, animals) from clutter from radar antenna signals.    ADVANTAGE - Because the CSP performs adaptive filtering, its hardware-based embodiment requires much less weight and power than current brute-force channelization methods. The CSP can cover an ultrawide bandwidth of over 30 GHz and yet still exhibit very low latencies on the order of 0.1 nanoseconds. The CSP can perform the denoising operation using only a single input antenna. The CSP is capable of denoising signals in real-time using a constraint that covers a wide range of electromagnetic and acoustic signals of interest. The CSP utilizes the constraint that the waveforms of interest in a source signal can be linearly predicted over a short interval of time, which can be computed quickly with limited computational cost. The CSP can generate a real-time spectrogram of a complex input signal that can be implemented efficiently in hardware and generate a denoised waveform signal.

The logic device receives the Doppler-derived velocity from the position sensor, and determines an estimated relative position of the mobile structure based on the received Doppler-derived velocity and a prior estimated relative position of the mobile structure.    USE - Position sensing system for providing absolute positions using multiple global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). Can be used in measuring the position of a mobile structure e.g., a watercraft, aircraft, motor vehicle.    ADVANTAGE - Produces measured positions of a coupled mobile structure that can be used to generate remote sensing imagery that is less prone to noise jitter and drift and is thus more reliable and easier to interpret by consumers. The measured positions and remote sensor data may also be combined to provide reliable navigation or autopiloting for the mobile structure. Employs standalone position sensors/GNSS receivers (and not simply additional separate antenna) in order to ease implementation, increase scalability, and decrease cost e.g., the system can be implemented using relatively inexpensive off the shelf hardware, which can more easily be integrated with other systems of the mobile structure. A network of position sensors provide position measurements at a higher output rate than any individual position sensor is capable of, thus providing more rapid and precise position updates for time sensitive applications, such as high-speed marine navigation. Including orientation and/or position sensors (OPSs) within a remote sensing assembly reduces or eliminates timing errors due to non-synchronicity of the data from the sensing element and data sent from an external sensor over a network. The reduced error allows a helmsman to rely on distances and relative bearings to a coastline or structure on a seafloor or fish in the water, for example, and the increased accuracy facilitates a number of operational modes, such as closing or avoiding a target, overlaying remote imagery on a chart, tracking other vessels, relating targets to automatic identification system (AIS) information, and/or other operational modes. An embedded OPS can be implemented at reduced cost as the various types of orientation and position sensors constituting the OPS can share power supplies, processing devices, interfaces, and the enclosure/housing of the associated remote sensing system.
